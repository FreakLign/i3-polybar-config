# i3-polybar-config
My i3 configuration with polybar for HiDPI screen (4k).

In `i3/15inch4k` You can also find a script to download the national geographic image of the day and set it as wallpaper and for i3lock.
You probably have to replace some path (try `find . -type f  -exec grep -l "path/to" {} \;`)
